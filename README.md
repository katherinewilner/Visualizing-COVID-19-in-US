# Visualizing-COVID-19-in-US
How can we visualize and better understand the overall toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on US counties or county equivalents?

### It is important for researchers to visualize the spread of COVID-19 so that they can see how rapidly the disease is spreading. Additionally, researchers and doctors can tell which direction the virus is spreading, so that hospitals in these areas can be better prepared.

### Although my code didn't create a reliable map indicating where and how the virus was spreading (I kept getting error messages stating that defined variables were not defined), there are several resources available to understand how the virus is spreading, including the JHU Coronavirus Research Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Here, we can see the progression of the virus and how it quickly affects dense cities, such as New York.

### In this map, courtesy of chttps://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/covid-19-map-visualizations, we can see that although the virus was first introduced on the west coast, it rapidly spread to the east. This leads us to ask the questions, "How might our data visualizations help county and state leadership or business owners in the US? 
### To answer this question, further research we might need is total number of deaths, not just total number of cases. This is important because testing is not widely available in all areas, thus the true number of cases is unknown. However, the number of deaths is known because it's easier to count bodies. With this added information, this could indicate to US business owners when it is safe to reopen their businesses. If a certain area has a low number of cases and deaths, it would be appropriate to reopen an establishment. Additionally, with an interactive map such as this one, we would be able to see when total number of cases/deaths begin to decrease, which would indicate that there is a possibility for businesses to open in the near future.
