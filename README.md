# Visualizing-COVID-19-in-US
How can we visualize and better understand the overall toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on US counties or county equivalents?

### It is important for researchers to visualize the spread of COVID-19 so that they can see how rapidly the disease is spreading. Additionally, researchers and doctors can tell which direction the virus is spreading, so that hospitals in these areas can be better prepared.

### Although my code didn't create a reliable map indicating where and how the virus was spreading (I kept getting error messages stating that defined variables were not defined), there are several resources available to understand how the virus is spreading, including the JHU Coronavirus Research Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Here, we can see the progression of the virus and how it quickly affects dense cities, such as New York.
